    "# Goal of Post#2 : provide a discussion of the main aspects of PEP8, the Python formatting guidelines for everything you may stick in your .py file or python based notebook. Throughout, I will focus on the main points I see as important and will explain the show the correct way to do something as opposed to the wrong way which there are millions.  Also the zen of python I recall states there should be one apparent way to Python some piece of code. After showing what the pep8 says about a topic and showing a code example, I will discuss in the code cell beneath. Some examples taken and adapted from: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"
